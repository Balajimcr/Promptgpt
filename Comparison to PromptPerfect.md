# Comparison Metrics: 

1. **Adherence to Best Practices:** A score of 1 in this category would mean that the prompt barely follows any best practices in prompt engineering, which may lead to ineffective interaction. A score of 5, on the other hand, indicates that the prompt follows best practices effectively, including clarity, encouraging user engagement, and providing actionable instructions.

2. **Clarity:** A score of 1 in clarity suggests that the prompt is confusing and does not clearly define what the user should do or what response to expect from the AI. Conversely, a score of 5 denotes a prompt that is very clear and leaves no room for misunderstanding for the user or the AI.

3. **Specificity:** A score of 1 here indicates that the prompt is either too vague, leading to potentially broad or unrelated responses, or excessively specific, leading to limited and constrained responses. A score of 5, on the other hand, shows that the prompt is well balanced in specificity—it's not too broad or too narrow and encourages a range of effective responses.

4. **User Context Integration:** A score of 1 in this category would mean that the prompt does not take into account the user's situation, preferences, or needs, leading to responses that might not be relevant to the user. A score of 5 indicates high integration of user context into the prompt, leading to personalized and highly relevant responses.

5. **Potential Effectiveness for ChatGPT:** A score of 1 here indicates that the prompt does not effectively guide the AI to provide useful responses. It might involve asking the AI to perform tasks outside of its capabilities, like access real-time or highly specialized knowledge. A score of 5 means that the prompt is well suited to the AI's capabilities and guides it to produce effective responses.
